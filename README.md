The code found in this repository is used to select disease information (Dengue, Chagas and leishmaniasis) from the repositories of the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INEC) for income and expenditure information. The information in the INEC repository can be coded or uncoded, so this code also codes information from the years that are not coded.
